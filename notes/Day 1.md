# Day 1 Notes

JavaScript is the broswer based language and it is widely used in both browser and out of the browser.

What in broswer JavaScript not Able to do :

1. JavaScript can not able to read files which is in the harddisk and can't able to manipulate with OS of the machine. It can only do any specific things on the demand and premission of user explicitly.

2. JavaScript have very strict on the client side which causes it was not able to read another tab information from existing tab.

3. JavaScript help fetch pages from remote server and it was not possible to access another page with the same request until there is explicitly agreement with the remote server and specifically mention in the HTTP Headers.

## Type Coercion

This is another one of JavaScript's most famous quirks, known as **Type Coercion.**

```
console.log(3 + '5');
```

Instead of getting 8, the output of console.log(3 + '5'); will be the string '35'.

Here is a breakdown of exactly why JavaScript does this:

### The Dual Personality of the + Operator

```
console.log(3 + '5');
```

In JavaScript, the + sign has two entirely different jobs:

- Mathematical Addition: Adding numbers together (e.g., 3 + 5 = 8).

- String Concatenation: Gluing text together (e.g., 'Hello' + 'World' = 'HelloWorld').

How JavaScript Decides

When JavaScript looks at 3 + '5', it sees that one side is a number (3) and the other side is a string ('5').

When there is a clash like this, JavaScript has a strict rule: String Concatenation always wins. Because the + operator sees a string, it panics and assumes you want to glue text together. So, it secretly converts your number 3 into the string '3', and simply glues them side-by-side to make '35'.
The Plot Twist: Other Math Operators

Here is where JavaScript gets really weird. This gluing behavior only happens with the + operator. If you use minus, multiply, or divide, JavaScript suddenly flips its logic and assumes you meant to do math!

- console.log('5' - 3); // Outputs the number 2

- console.log('5' \* 3); // Outputs the number 15

- console.log('15' / 3); // Outputs the number 5

In all of these cases, JavaScript secretly converts the string '5' into a number so it can do the math.

### The Hidden Numbers Behind True and False

```
console.log(true + 1); // Your prediction: ?
```

When you try to do standard math (like addition, subtraction, or multiplication) with a boolean, JavaScript secretly converts that boolean into a number so the math can work.

In JavaScript's brain:

- true always converts to the number 1

- false always converts to the number 0

### Empty string and False

```
console.log('' == false); // Your prediction: ?
```

This one is going to output true!

You are officially exploring the deepest, darkest corners of JavaScript's Type Coercion now. This specific behavior is exactly why so many developers have a love-hate relationship with the language.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how JavaScript's brain justifies making an empty string equal to false:

**1. The "Loose Equality" Operator (==)**

You are using the double equals sign (==). In JavaScript, this is the "loose equality" operator. It tells JavaScript: "I don't care if these two things are different data types. Try your best to convert them into the same type, and then tell me if they look similar."

**2. The Conversion Process**

Because JavaScript is forced to compare a String ('') and a Boolean (false), it decides the fairest way to compare them is to turn them both into Numbers first.

    Step 1: It looks at the boolean false. As we saw in the last question, JavaScript converts false into the number 0.

    Step 2: It looks at the empty string ''. Since there is literally nothing inside it, JavaScript converts an empty string into the number 0.

    Step 3: Now, the equation it is actually running behind the scenes is 0 == 0.

    Step 4: Since 0 is equal to 0, it outputs true.

**The Solution: Strict Equality**

Because this hidden conversion can cause massive, hard-to-find bugs in your code, modern JavaScript developers almost entirely stopped using ==.

### Null and Undefined

```
console.log(null == undefined); // Your prediction: ?
```

This one is going to output true!

You have hit on one of the few exceptions where JavaScript's loose equality (==) actually behaves predictably, but it does so because of a hardcoded rule rather than standard type coercion.

Here is why JavaScript treats null and undefined as equals:

**1. The "Absence of Value" Rule**

In JavaScript, both null and undefined represent the concept of "nothing."

- undefined means a variable has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it yet. (It is the default state).

- null is an intentional empty value. It is a way for a developer to explicitly say, "This variable is intentionally empty."

Because they both fundamentally represent "no value," the creators of JavaScript wrote a specific rule into the language specification: when using loose equality (==), null and undefined equal each other, and they do not equal anything else.

**2. The Strict Equality Counterpart**

Just like with the empty string and false example, if you want to be safe, you should use strict equality (===).

If you write console.log(null === undefined);, the output will be false.
This is because strict equality checks the underlying data type, and they are completely different types under the hood.

### Addition of Empty Objects

```
console.log([] + []); // Your prediction: ?
```

Specifically, it outputs an empty string: "".

You have just stumbled into one of the most infamous JavaScript memes in existence. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of why adding two empty arrays equals an empty string:

**1. The + Operator vs. Objects**

As we saw earlier, the + operator prefers to either do math (with numbers) or glue things together (with strings).

An Array [] is technically an Object in JavaScript. The + operator doesn't know how to add two complex objects together, so it forces them to turn into "primitives" (basic data types like strings or numbers) first.

**2. The .toString() Conversion**

When JavaScript forces an Array to become a primitive, it does so by running the Array's built-in .toString() method under the hood.

- Normally, if you had [1, 2, 3].toString(), it would convert it to the string "1,2,3".

- But because your arrays are completely empty [], calling .toString() on them just results in an empty string "".

**3. The Final Equation**

Once JavaScript converts both arrays, the equation it actually runs looks like this:
"" + ""

_It glues two completely empty strings together, which leaves you with one empty string!_

## In my own words (explain to 12-year-old):

Today I learned that JavaScript has strict rules about what counts as a number.
Even though NaN means "Not a Number", it's technically a number type (confusing!).
I built a calculator that checks three things: is it a number type, is it not NaN,
and is it finite (not infinity). This prevents crashes from bad inputs.

## What I got wrong:

- [List any prediction errors from type-checking.js]

## Tomorrow's preview:

Control flow: if/else, switch, loops. I'll build FizzBuzz with rules that can change.
